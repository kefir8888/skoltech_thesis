# Skoltech MSc thesis template
This is an unofficial LaTeX template for MSc thesis in a Skoltech university. Many thanks to Nikolai Semenov (tg:semenovn) as he did most part of the work.

## How to use it?
put a star, than fork this repository.

## Is it a complete folder?
No. Times New Roman font is a requirement. However, it is a proprietary font and I can't upload it legally:( 
To add fonts, please, open Skoltech telegram chat and find a link to "fonts.zip". Than, extract it to folder "fonts" in the repository (like skoltech\_thesis\_template/fonts/times.ttf).

## How should I compile the files? 
I tested it with texlive under Ubuntu (18.04). Use XeLaTeX (+ BibTex) option. 

## I love to work online!
That's fine, we respect it. Upload the project from GitHub to your Overleaf account, open it, add a folder "fonts" as it is written here, and in the Menu of Overleaf change the type of Compiler to "XeLaTeX". Thanks to tg:baibakovaVika 

Recipes for other toolchains are highly welcomed! write tg:safoex.
